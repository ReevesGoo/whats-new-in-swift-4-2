# What’s new in Swift 4.2

An Xcode playground demonstrating the new features in Swift 4.2.

Written by [Ole Begemann](https://oleb.net), June–September 2018.

The playground requires Swift 4.2. Xcode 10 includes Swift 4.2 by default. [Download the latest Xcode 10 beta](https://developer.apple.com/download/).

You can also run it in Xcode 9.4, but you need to install [the latest Swift 4.2 snapshot from swift.org](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots) (don’t worry, it’s easy).
