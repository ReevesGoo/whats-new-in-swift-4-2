 ## Requirements

 This playground requires Swift 4.2, which ships with Xcode 10. Download Xcode 10 [from Apple’s Developer Site](https://developer.apple.com/download/) or [from the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12), or download a Swift 4.2 snapshot [from swift.org](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots).

 ## Note

 This playground focuses on user-facing new features that can easily be demonstrated in a playground. Swift 4.2 ships with more changes, such as new Swift Package Manager features and many under-the-hood improvements.

 Check out [the full changelog](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), as well as [the complete list of proposals implemented for Swift 4.2](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/#?version=4.2) (which lists some proposals not mentioned in the changelog).
